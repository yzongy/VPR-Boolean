% encoding of prime implicants as hyper-arcs that consist of a unique "target" and (possibly) several "sources".
% "target" and "source" are triplets that consist of a variable name, an activity and a unique arc-identifier. 


% generator: "in_set(ID)" specifies which arcs are chosen for a trap set (ID is unique for target(_,_,_)).
{in_set(ID) : target(V,S,ID)}.

% consistency constraint
:- in_set(ID1), in_set(ID2), target(V,1,ID1), target(V,0,ID2).

% stability constraint
:- in_set(ID1), source(V,S,ID1), not in_set(ID2) : target(V,S,ID2).

% bijection constraint (between asp solutions and trap spaces)
% to avoid the repetition of equivalent solutions we add all prime implicants
% that agree with the current solution.
in_set(ID) :- target(V,S,ID), hit(V,S), hit(V1,S1) : source(V1,S1,ID).

% "hit" captures the stable variables and their activities.
hit(V,S) :- in_set(ID), target(V,S,ID).

% show fixed nodes
#show hit/2.
